## SENERGY

SENERGY is a smart service platform which enables the automated integration, (pre-)processing and analysis of sensor data. It also supports business process automation by leveraging IoT technologies and advanced data analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. The platform has been designed for cross-sectoral application possibilities (e.g. energy management, health, security, convenience and entertainment) in many different IoT scenarios.

## AKSW
Agile Knowldge Engineering and Semantic Web research network (AKSW) is a scientific network, distributed over various universities and scientific institutes (including InfAI), whose members are involved in various national and international research and software projects. Technologies from the field of semantic web and linked data are primarily developed and evaluated. The following repository/organisation contains publicly available project artifacts for which AKSW is directly responsible.
